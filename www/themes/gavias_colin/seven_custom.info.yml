# This theme is marked as @internal. It is intended to evolve and change over
# minor releases.
# Change record https://www.drupal.org/node/2582945.
# As the UI of Drupal improves between minor versions, the mark up and assets
# in the Seven theme will change. The Seven theme is not backwards
# compatible. If you wish to modify the output or assets of Seven you can:
# 1. Copy the whole of Seven and rename it as your own administration theme. You
# will need to manually manage your own updates if you want to stay up to
# date with Seven's bug fixes and feature support.
#
# 2. Sub-theme Seven. This is only recommended if you want to make minor
# tweaks and understand that Seven could break your modifications as it
# changes.
